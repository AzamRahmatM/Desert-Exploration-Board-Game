# Desert Exploration Board Game

A turn-based desert exploration game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game allows up to 4 players to navigate a grid-based desert map, search for water, and uncover hidden parts to complete the exploration before running out of resources.

## Features

- **Player Management**: Supports up to 4 players with individual stats (water and actions) displayed on the screen.
- **Dynamic Grid Board**: The desert is represented as a 5x5 grid. Players can move around, dig for parts, and encounter special tiles like oases or mirages.
- **Randomly Placed Parts**: Three critical parts are randomly hidden in the grid, which players need to find in order to win.
- **Oases and Mirages**: Special grid cells that can either replenish a player’s water (oasis) or provide misleading clues (mirage).
- **Key Controls**: Players can move using the W, A, S, D keys and dig using the E key to uncover hidden parts.

## Gameplay Overview

Players start with a limited amount of water and actions. The objective is to find the hidden parts scattered around the desert while managing water and actions. Players can interact with various cells on the board, including:

- **Oasis**: Replenishes water for the player.
- **Mirage**: A tricky cell that doesn't provide any real benefit.
- **Parts**: The ultimate goal is to find all parts hidden in the desert.

Each player’s status is updated in real-time, displaying their remaining water, actions, and any parts they’ve found.
